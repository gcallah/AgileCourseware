            Python for Agile Courseware
        </h1>

            Gene Callahan and Vivek Bharti
        </p>

        <p>
            We would like to present our agile courseware project at PyGotham
            2018, with a focus on the Python programs we have written to
            support our efforts.  Agile courseware is a way delivering teaching
            materials more easily, rapidly, correctly and collaboratively.
            Below are the various benefits of Agile Courseware compared to the
            LMS systems in place at most universities:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Itâ€™s easier to share since it is all web-based and just
                involves sharing the course link instead of sharing any files
                etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                One can easily use the material for an in-person or an
                online class.
            </li>
            <li>
                It leads to continuous learning because it is all open source
                material. Others can contribute and expand the knowledge base.
            </li>
            <li>
                The text-based material can easily be processed by scripts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Version control helps other contributors to contribute much
                conveniently and there is no back and forth of files as well as
                no information loss.
            </li>
            <li>
                Further this approach can be used to co-author, not just courseware
                but also books, papers, journals and software projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
