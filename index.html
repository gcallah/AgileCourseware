            <p>
                We might better call this "DevOps Courseware"...
                except that doesn't sound as good, does it?
            </p>

            <p>
                A point I will stress again later: I am not here trying to tell
                anyone how to prepare their courses! And I certainly am not
                suggesting everyone drop what they are doing and do things my
                way!

                                Agile courseware is not a rival to, or
                                replacement for, a system like Classes. It
                                <i>complements</i> a system like Classes.

                                Course materials are easily shared among faculty:
                                <br />
                                No emailing of bulky PowerPoint files.
                                <br />
                                Work is in open, text-based formats: parts can
                                easily be extracted for use elsewhere.
                                <br />The work exists in open repositories on
                                the Internet.

                                Because materials are based on open standards,
                                generally text-based, and stored in public
                                repositories, it is easy for other faculty
                                members to learn how any "neat trick" was done.
                                <br />
                                Not so easy for PowerPoint, etc.

                                Only a text editor and Internet access are
                                needed to deploy new versions. No need to
                                access PowerPoint, fetch files from a laptop,
                                login to a special machine, etc.

                                I don't need to remember what I've updated from
                                my desktop when I get on my laptop to work on a
                                course. No need to download particular files
                                from Blackboard, Moodle, Classes, etc. to have
                                my laptop up-to-date:
                                <br />
                                I just run "git pull" and every new file is on
                                whatever machine I am using!
                                <br />
                                I don't even need one of my machines with me: I
                                have accounts on PythonAnywhere, and I can log
                                in from a public terminal, or a podium PC,
                                pull the latest material, update a mistake, and
                                push it back to the repository. The whole
                                process takes less than a minute.

                            Faculty can keep working as they have been, and
                            gradually incorporate more "Agile Courseware" into
                            their practice.

                                    When I made it collapsible,
                                    it took 4 lines of awk code,
                                    not 28 lines of HTML, because the menu is
                                    generated by a script and a text file.

                                    There is a new edition of CLRS coming: we
                                    will change chapters.txt, and a new main
                                    menu will emerge from our build process!
                                    <br />
                                    That same text file is used to build the
                                    language table as well.
