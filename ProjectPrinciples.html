        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A little bit of work each day is much better than big bursts of
                work once in a while.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't try to do "the whole project": attack the big project as
                a series of micro-projects, each of which you code, test, and
                have reviewed separately.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continuous integration: keep integrating your work with the
                entire project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make work visible: don't wait until you have "a lot" done to
                push to public repo and get your work reviewed: correct
                mistakes early by early review!
            </li>
        </ul>
