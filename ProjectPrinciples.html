                A little bit of work each day is much better than big bursts of
                work once in a while.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continuous integration: keep integrating your work with the
                entire project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make work visible: don't wait until you have "a lot" done to
                push to public repo and get your work reviewed: correct
                mistakes early by early review!
            </li>
